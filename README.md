# Contacts Database

i have created a contacts database implemented in python while using SQLite3. it allows users to store names permanently, add new contacts, search for a name that is currently in the database, update any existing numbers and delete any contact from the database. Each contact in the database contains a name and a number.
within this app data is stored permenantly and prevents duplications.
